          - speech: Place one of your hands on top of the other and clasp them together.  With
              the heel of the hands and straight elbows, push hard and fast in the
              center of the chest, slightly below the nipples.  Push at least 2 inches
              deep. Compress their chest at a rate of least 100 times per minute.
              Let the chest rise fully between compressions. After 30 chest compressions,
              open the airway by lifting the chin slightly. Give two rescue breaths
              by pinching their nose and blowing hard into their mouth.  If chest
              does not rise, there might be an obstruction. Repeat the 30 chest compressions
              and 2 rescue breaths until the person starts breathing. If an A.E.D.
              arrives, continue performing CPR until the A.E.D. is ready to use. If
              the patient gains consciousness, say "Hey Google, what's next?"
